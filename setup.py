    long_description="""
Surreal is a library allowing rapid (within one(!) day) development and implementation of published reinforcement
learning algos. It comes with many state-of-the-art benchmark algos that can be run out of the box against
popular envs (e.g. openAI gym) as well as UnrealEngine4 games.
The main development focus is on environment/game controlled execution (e.g. from within UE4), 
mixing different algos, multi-agent learning (adversarial and cooperative), distributed execution (cloud),
model-based RL, hierarchical RL, and intrinsic motivation.
