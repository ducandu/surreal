        Args:
            record_space (Space): The Space of the records that will go into this memory. May be ContainerSpace.
            capacity (int): Maximum capacity of the memory.

            next_record_setup (Optional[Dict[str,str]]): If given, will specify, which field(s) (keys) in the
                record_space should return the corresponding field(s) (values) of the "next" records, thereby
                respecting a possible batch size with which entries come in.
                If `next_record_setup` is provided, the batch size sent to `add_records` must always be
                the same, otherwise an error is raised.
                The setup reduces the amount of memory needed by 50% in some cases (e.g. Atari RL environments).
                All records passed to `add_records` must have the "next" fields given as specified in the value(s) of
                the Dict.
                E.g.
                `next_record_setup`=dict(s="s_", a="a_"): This will always return the s_ and a_ fields in all
                    records produced by `get_records`, whose values are taken from the respective s/a fields of
                    the next record. In return, the memory expects s_ and a_ to be set in each call to `add_records`.

                For an n-step setup, the extra key: `n_step` is required in `next_record_setup`. This key holds the
                number of steps to span over. Corresponds to the `n_step` config parameter in RLAlgos that support
                n-step learning.

            enforce_batch_size (bool): Whether to strictly enforce the consistency in size of each added batch. If True,
                each call to `add_records` must have the same batch_size in the incoming `records`.
